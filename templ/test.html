                        <li>Invadopodia are found in cancer cells with high metastatic potential, whilst podosomes are generally present in blood cells of myeloid and monocytic lineages.</li>
                        <li>Invadopodia are elongated ventral projections into the underlying ECM, whereas podosomes are rarely seen to project into the matrix.</li>
                        <li>Invadopodia are few in number, approximately between 1 to 10 per cell, whilst podosome numbers can range between 10 to several hundred depending upon the cell type.</li>

In addition to the podosome-like structure at their base, invadopodia additionally contain a substantial number of actin filaments arranged as parallel bundles, akin to those observed in filopodia. Cross-linking proteins such as fascin are abundant in invadopodia, indeed there is a strong correlation between cancer cell invasive potential and fascin expression (<span name="">[<a name="PMID:20137952" href="#PMID20137952">20137952</a>]</span>, as reviewed in&nbsp;<span name="">[<a name="PMID:20714410" href="#PMID20714410">20714410</a>]</span>). Invadopodia also differ from podosomes in their lack of the well established multimeric protein complex that encircles the podosomal actin core&nbsp;<span name="">[<a name="PMID:18460310" href="#PMID18460310">18460310</a>]</span>.&nbsp;<br/><br/>It is well established that a ring of integrins are present in podosomes and mediate adhesion with the ECM. However the presence of integrins in and around the actin core of invadopodia is still under debate. In recent years as podosomes and invadopodia have begun to be identified as similar but nonetheless distinct structures, few studies have shown integrins associated with invadopodia or a role for integrin-dependent adhesion in invadopodia&nbsp;<span name="">[<a name="PMID:21801014" href="#PMID21801014">21801014</a>]</span>.&nbsp;<br/><br/><div>
